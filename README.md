# Deadman's Inventory Counter

## Motivation
I want to be able to scan diffrent barcodes and a total at the end. If a new barcode is scanned then, it should be added to the dictionary; otherwise a simple increment. 

At somepoint it should have a GUI as well as pull data from Zoho to see if everything lines up.
